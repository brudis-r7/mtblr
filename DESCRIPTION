Title: Tools to work with 'mtbl' files
Version: 0.3.0.9000
Date: 2016-06-01
Author: Bob Rudis (@hrbrmstr)
Maintainer: Bob Rudis <bob@rudis.net>
Description: mtbl files are an implementation of the 'Sorted String Table' data
    structure, based on the 'SSTable' implementation in the open source Google 'LevelDB'
    library. An 'SSTable' is a file containing an immutable mapping of keys to values.
    Keys are stored in sorted order, with an index at the end of the file allowing keys to
    be located quickly. Tools to search and iterate over 'mtbl' files are provided.
